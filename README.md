# Smart Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution Platform

## 📌 Project Overview
Citizens often face difficulties in reporting and resolving civic issues such as potholes, broken streetlights, waste accumulation, and water supply problems.  
This project aims to build a **web-based crowdsourced platform** where citizens can report issues in real-time, and municipal authorities can track, prioritize, and resolve them efficiently.  

The platform promotes **transparency, accountability, and community participation**, strengthening trust between citizens and governing bodies.
